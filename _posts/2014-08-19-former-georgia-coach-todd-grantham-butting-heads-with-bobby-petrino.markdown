Thayer Evans & Pete Thamel for SI.com:

>Bobby Petrino says he’s changed. But in reporting a story about the new Louisville coach that is in SI’s college football preview, it appears Petrino is still just as difficult to work and play for. Sources with ties to the Cardinals’ football program and Petrino said there’s significant friction between Petrino and feisty defensive coordinator Todd Grantham. The two have feuded often since Grantham’s hiring in January.

Grantham was no stranger to confrontation at Georgia and it looks like he and his new head coach are butting heads now.  Grantham was hand picked by Petrino to lead Louisville's defense after the departure of Charlie Strong to Texas.  It will be interesting to see how this relationship blossoms.
