Marc Weiszer for the Athens Banner-Herald:

> Coach Mark Richt has said Barber has the lead over Adam Erickson as the No. 1 punter as the Bulldogs prepare to open the season against Clemson a week from Saturday. Barber didnâ€™t play in the final two regular season games last season against Kentucky and Georgia Tech and in the Gator Bowl against Nebraska after Erickson took over.
> 
> Barber, from Cartersville, worked on drills this offseason with his personal kicking coach, Marc Nolan of Roswell, to make sure the ball was where it needed to be on the drop.

Barber looks to have the early advantage.  Last year's Special Teams failures were significant which led to the change at Punter.  It will be interesting to see how Barber performs should he earn the job.
