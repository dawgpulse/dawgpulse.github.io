Georgia will begin the season at #12 in the AP and Coaches Poll.  Here is your top 25 in the AP Poll:

> 1. Florida State
> 2. Alabama
> 3. Oregon
> 4. Oklahoma
> 5. Ohio State
> 6. Auburn
> 7. UCLA
> 8. Michigan state
> 9. South Carolina
> 10. Baylor
> 11. Stanford
> 12. Georgia
> 13. LSU
> 14. Wisconsin
> 15. USC
> 16. Clemson
> 17. Notre Dame
> 18. Ole Miss
> 19. Arizona State
> 20. Kansas State
> 21. Texas A&M
> 22. Nebraska
> 23. North Carolina
> 24. Missouri
> 25. Washington

I think Ohio State will fall after the first week if Braxton Miller is out indefinitely.  USC, Notre Dame and Wisconsin feel too high while Missouri, Stanford and Auburn feel too low.
