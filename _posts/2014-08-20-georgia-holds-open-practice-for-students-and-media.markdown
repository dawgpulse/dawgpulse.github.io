The Georgia Bulldogs returned to practice Tuesday after being off for two days and to the surprise of the media, Mark Richt decided to let them and students observe the second half of practice. Here were some observations:

> The starting offensive line consisted of John Theus at left tackle, Brandon Kublanow at left guard, David Andrew at center, Greg Pyke at right guard and Kolton Houston at right tackle.
>
>Todd Gurley did what Todd Gurley does. He took a miniscule crack in the middle of the line and burst through it, not stopping until he was in the endzone.
>
>The starting secondary that we saw consisted of Corey Moore and Aaron Davis at the safety spots, Damian Swann and Shattle Fenteng at the cornerback positions and freshman Dominick Sanders at the star.

Overall it sounds like the Georgia team is shaping up to be much of what we expected preseason with some freshmen sprinkled in that have emerged.  Lorenzo Carter and Isaiah McKenzie continue to have strong camps and will see considerable playing time.  Nick Chubb and Sony Michel received a lot of reps and the coaches continue to emphasize that they will play early and often.
