Chris Starrs for Athens Banner-Herald:

> ...as the Bulldogs’ Aug. 30 opener against Clemson moves closer, Douglas again doesn’t harbor any expectation as to when or if he’ll be called upon. Besides a healthier Gurley and Marshall, Douglas is also sharing practice time with high-profile freshmen Sony Michel and Nick Chubb, making for at least one spot where Georgia has an enviable surplus of bodies.

Douglas had a couple of key fumbles last season but filled in nicely considering he was a true freshman.
