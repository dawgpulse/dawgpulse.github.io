Marc Weiszer for Athens Banner-Herald:

> When the Bulldogs’ seniors got together this offseason, they decided to ditch branding the 2014 season with a mantra heading into the era of the four-team College Football Playoff. Their “One Dream,” last season fell far short of a BCS national title game trip.

Chris Conley:

>This team has all the pieces. You can see it out at practice, you can see that talent. You can see the coaching. Now it’s up to us to put those two things together and play a great season.”
