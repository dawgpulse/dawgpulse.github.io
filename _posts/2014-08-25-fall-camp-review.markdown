Logan Book for Bulldawg Illustrated:

> It has been more than apparent that what happened throughout an 8-5 season this time last year is not acceptable going forward, and there are new sheriffs around to uphold the new rules. And while the names of Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall are quite household in these parts, the preseason has given glimpse of the predecessors that appear more than worthy of filling the void when the time comes that they depart. Nick Chubb has entered the realm of folklore with his displays of strength and running-style that mimics Gurley, while Sony Michel is quickly becoming the track star weâ€™ve seen from Marshall.

>You often hear about a culture change in sports when key pieces are replaced or shown the door. That notion has been nothing short of obvious over the past four weeks roaming the sidelines with an open ear and eye. In addition to players panting and having their hands on their knees as they acclimate to the conditioning now being thrown upon them, the overall body language in both the coaches and players is quickly becoming a norm. No longer do players jog between practice stations; they sprint. No longer are coaches asking players what to do; they are telling them.
