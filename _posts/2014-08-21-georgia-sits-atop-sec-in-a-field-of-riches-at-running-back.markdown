Sports Illustrated writes about the great depth of talent the SEC has at Running Back this year.  Fortunately for Georgia fans, the stable Mark Richt has assembled in Athens might be the best of the bunch.

> Six of the SEC’s top 10 most productive running backs return this season. Of those, at least three -- Georgia’s Todd Gurley, Alabama’s T.J. Yeldon and South Carolina’s Mike Davis -- could be considered preseason Heisman Trophy candidates. But veterans are only one piece of the league’s embarrassment of backfield riches. Highly touted freshmen such as Tennessee’s Jalen Hurd, Georgia’s Sony Michel and Nick Chubb and, most notably, LSU’s Leonard Fournette have many offensive coordinators salivating.
