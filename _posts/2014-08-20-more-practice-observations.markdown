Logan Booker, for Bulldawg Illustrated,  has a lot of observations from yesterday's open practice::

> Rico Johnson got a pick-six on Brice Ramsey, but Blake Tibbs was the one to blame as the ball popped out of his hands in what should have been a 5-yardreception. 
> 
> Shattle Fenteng continues to impress, and made a greta pass breakup on what was (at one time) a very open Shakenneth Williams. 
>
> McKenzie returned a kickoff where he very impressively split some defenders and got to the edge. Had it been a live I have very little doubt that he wouldn;t have shaken the kicker and run it to the house.
